*DESCRIPTION*
This Python project is designed to fetch real-time weather forecast data using the OpenWeatherMap API and visualize it using Matplotlib and Seaborn. The script retrieves weather details such as temperature, humidity, and wind speed for a specified city and presents them as easy-to-understand line charts. The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate API integration, data extraction, and visualization techniques, making it valuable for developers, data analysts, and students exploring data science.

The script utilizes the requests library to fetch weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API. This library simplifies making HTTP requests and handling API responses. The script sends a GET request to retrieve weather information in JSON format. If an error occurs, such as an invalid API key or connectivity issues, the script handles exceptions using requests.exceptions.RequestException to ensure smooth execution. The fetched data is then processed to extract key weather parameters, including timestamps, temperature, humidity, and wind speed. These values are stored in lists for further analysis and visualization.
For data visualization, Matplotlib and Seaborn are used. Matplotlib provides a robust framework for creating plots, while Seaborn enhances the aesthetics of the graphs. The script generates three separate line charts, each representing a different weather parameter. The first chart visualizes temperature trends over time, the second shows humidity levels, and the third illustrates wind speed variations. The sns.lineplot() function is used to create smooth and readable line graphs with markers at each data point. Additionally, plt.xticks(rotation=45) ensures that the timestamp labels are easily readable, preventing overlap. The plt.tight_layout() function optimizes spacing between the subplots, improving overall clarity.
This project has various real-world applications. It can be used for weather monitoring, enabling users to track upcoming changes in atmospheric conditions. Businesses, particularly those in logistics, agriculture, and event planning, can use such forecasts to make informed decisions. The script can also be extended into a dashboard using tools like Flask or Streamlit, allowing users to dynamically enter different city names and retrieve real-time weather data. Additionally, features like historical weather comparisons, additional weather parameters (e.g., air pressure, precipitation), and machine learning-based trend predictions could further enhance the project's functionality.
Overall, this project effectively demonstrates how to work with APIs, extract and process real-time data, and visualize it meaningfully. It serves as a great learning experience for beginners looking to explore data-driven applications in Python. The modular nature of the script allows for easy expansion and customization, making it a practical and scalable solution for weather analysis.
